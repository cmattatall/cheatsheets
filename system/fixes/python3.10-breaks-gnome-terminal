As of May 1, 2022, On ubuntu 18.04, and 20.04, gnome-terminal requires python3.8, 
but the shell script has a shebang for #!/usr/bin/python3, so configuring update-alternatives
for newer versions of python3 breaks the terminal.

Solution is to change the shebang in /usr/bin/gnome-terminal to refer to the explicit version
Replace #!/usr/bin/python3 -> #!/usr/bin/python3.8
